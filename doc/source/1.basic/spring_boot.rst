overview
=======================
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

If youâ€™re looking for information about a specific version, or instructions about how to upgrade from an earlier release, check out the project release notes section on our wiki.

Features
=======================
* Create stand-alone Spring applications
* Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
* Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
* Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
* Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
